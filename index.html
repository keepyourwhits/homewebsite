								<h2>Overview</h2>

								<p>This project aims to provide meaningful concert experiences
									for individuals who might not otherwise have access to live
									musical performances. For years, organizations have provided
									free tickets to individuals whose daily life might not provide
									them with the opportunity to experience live musical
									performances. These  concerts aim to flip the paradigm by
									bringing the musician to the audience as a way to bridge gaps
									in our communities where live instrumental music is not
									usually found. Eric will seek out audiences at places like
									domestic violence shelters, long-term care facilities,
									 prisons, juvenile detention centers, community centers,
									 and places of worship in order to provide as many people
									  as possible with quality musical performances.
										These performances will emphasize aspects of community
										building using intimate performance as a vehicle to share
										artistic expression.
										</p>

								<p>These concerts are designed to be enjoyable to anyone who
									might wish to join. Rather than providing guided listening,
									Eric aims to simply share music with a key focus on curating
									concerts of widely accessible music for a broad spectrum of
									audience members. In order to achieve these goals, Eric will
									partner with living composers to write works that are based
									around a fundamental idea that many people can find relatable.
									Through these performances, Eric hopes to provide entertaining
									performances that demonstrate that all kinds of music are for
									 everyone.
									</p>

									<h2>For Composers</h2>

									<p>I am seeking composers to collaborate with so that I can
										showcase their music as a part of this project. In exchange
										for a composer’s participation in this project, I will provide
										them with a high-quality audio and video recording of their
										 work, in addition to coachings on how to compose for
										 percussion. Ideally, this work will be primarily for solo
										 vibraphone, though additional instruments or speaking parts
										  can be added after consultation with me.
											Additionally works for this project should be based around
											 ideas/concepts that a wide range of audience members
											  can have a connection with. Some examples of this
												 could be a theme and variation on a popular song,
												 a piece that explores a musical form, a work that
												 explores a place/feeling/time, etc. Any composer
												 interested in participating should reach out <a href="#contact">here</a>
										 to set up a time to talk about their proposal.
